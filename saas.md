## SaaS considerations:

- email templates for each step are available (preferably with styles to choose from [e.g. twitter-like])
- workflow dependency mapper: define at which point which action is required (easy drag and drop). Also different templates are ready to choose from
- no need to log in for everyone - it's email based where possible (crypto links to the webapp)
